# Password Generator 

This project was designed as a functional tool for an end user to be able to generate a random password. The application focuses on the use of JavaScript to generate a random password. 

The end user will be prompted for how long they want the password to be, and then the application will allow the user to choose which kind of charater criteria they want the password to be generated with (i.e. lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters).
